<p>Lindsay Albert seemed nice at first, a young medical professional who seemed to have her stuff together, but became increasingly hostile and entitled as her time in our rental property went on. By the end, she threatened my pregnant wife (calling her highly emotional and irrational), wrote nasty things about my brother-in-law who had tried his best to be nice to her and her dogs, and threatened to sue us over a $100 deduction from her security deposit after she (and confirmed through email) put her elbow through a door. We even let her rent month-to-month at the end because she told us she wanted to move out, but when we later suggested that we were hoping to sell the house, she became upset with us and couldn't believe we'd put her in a position like that.</p>

<p>It pains me greatly that we had to indulge her entitled tendencies when she left, but she was threatening to sue and she had "brought a pregnant woman to small claims court before" and made it her clear intention that if we pursued holding her responsible for damages, that was going to be her course of action.  She specifically was threatening this because she knew a) the house is in Boston, Massachusetts and we were now in Texas and "the flight alone won't make it worth it to you", b) any sort of litigation would hold up the sale of the house and c) our baby was two weeks away from the due date and we had more important things to worry about.</p><br>

<p>Now, I've known worse tenants.  Heck, I had a landlord once (really nice guy) who lived with me in a 3 apartment building who couldn't evict the third tenant for *months* and *tons* of legal action despite the fact that they stopped paying rent and flooded both our floors with copious amounts of marijuana smoke.  So yes, I realize things could have been worse, but considering what a nice, put-together girl she seemed at first, I was very dissapointed at how unpleasant, inflammatory, entitled, and increasingly hostile she became later on.  We accomodated late/missing rent checks, working maintenance schedules around her and her pet's needs, and flexibility with month-to-month, and yet Lindsay Albert repaid us by trying to throw us under the bus the moment she wanted something.  Unequivocally the worst kind of person.</p><br>

<p>I think the worst part of all was that she repaid the kindness my brother-in-law showed her by trying to pass the blame off to him. The hot water heater went out at one point and she called him up and told him it had been out since the previous day at which point he, being the kind of guy who'd give you the shirt off his back, offered to drop everything (including his wife and two young kids) to go over and get it fixed.  She told him not to because it would upset her dogs and so he'd have to wait until later on when she'd be home (he had a key in case of emergencies like this).  By all accounts, it had been a very pleasant interaction.  But when it came time to move out, Lindsay claimed that she was being reasonable because "could have requested a hotel every time the water heater died, but I was nice and accommodating, and went to the YMCA before work to shower since I had no hot water."  Completely ignored the fact that she went without hot water because he was working around her schedule.</p>

<p>Lindsay repeatedly showed disrespect and hostility towards us when we were trying to be as pleasant and rational as possible.  She insulted and made inflammatory statement about the condition of the house (which we had lived in for 3 years prior to her occupation and was well regarded as a very pleasant home) and assumed we would take her at her word instead of the facts we knew.</p>

<p>So what is the lesson for future tenants and landlords here? <strong>Document. All. Interactions</strong>.  Make sure your Statement of Condition when you (or they) move is sufficiently thorough and agreed on by both parties.  If there are any underlying issues with something not on the original Statement of Condition, make sure you send some sort of email outlying *all* of the issues.  Even if they don't attend to them right away, you would be covered from liablity later on and lets the landlord know so he can do preventative and routine maintenance.  Also, taking pictures or videos of items gives you hard evidence of the conditions and concerns you might have and a concrete point at which that condition occured.</p>

<p>Long story short, Lindsay Albert turned out to be an entitled hassle for us, but you don't have to make the same mistake. Document everything, take pictures, and most of all...communicate with your landlord!  It might even turn out that they're nice people and just want to see that you're happy.  Getting to know eachother can make for better understanding from both sides and make sure everything goes much smoother!</p>
